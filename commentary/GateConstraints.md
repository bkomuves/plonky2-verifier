Gate constraints
----------------

Each type of gate (see [Gates.md](Gates.md) for the different gates supported by Plonky2) is defined by a set of polynomial equations (up to degree 8, though via a usual $\pm 1$ error Plonky2 may restrict this to degree 7) whose variables are cells in a single row in the witness.
